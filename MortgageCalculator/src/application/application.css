Assignment:

Create a JavaFX program that allows the user to input the following:

Total Gross Income

Total Monthly debt

Mortgage Interest Rate

Term (have this as a drop down, 10 years, 15 years, 30 years)

Down payment (numeric field, optional... default zero)

Calculate the following:

Housing payment only (18% of gross income):

Housing payment + other obligations (36% of gross income)

Maximum payment allowed (lower of the two payments)

Amount of mortgage that can be financed.

 

If the user changes any of the fields, re-calculate the amounts (change term, re-calculate amount, change down payment, re-calculate...)
